With significant contributions from darkeye, cleartonic, comrade_dik_dik

Based on the Universal Pokemon Randomizer by Dabomstew

# Info

This fork was made to solely implement an idea for a moon stone only evo mode. It will only work with FireRed/LeafGreen, no other games are currently supported. Comrade_dik_dik did 99.99% of the work for this fork. If anything isn't quite correct with credits or links that's my bad, I tried my best.

Have a look at the [release page](https://github.com/Alanim/universal-pokemon-randomizer-zx-with-stone-evos/releases) for changelogs and downloads.

# Contributing

If you want to contribute something to the codebase, we'd recommend creating an issue for it first (using the`Contribution Idea` template). This way, we can discuss whether or not it's a good fit for the randomizer before you put in the work to implement it. This is just to save you time in the event that we don't think it's something we want to accept.

See [the Wiki Page](https://github.com/Alanim/universal-pokemon-randomizer-zx-with-stone-evos/wiki/Building-Universal-Pokemon-Randomizer-ZX) for setting up to build/test locally.

### What is a good fit for the randomizer?

In general, we try to make settings as universal as possible. This means that it preferably should work in as many games as possible, and also that it's something that many people will find useful. If the setting is very niche, it will mostly just bloat the GUI.

If your idea is a change to an existing setting rather than a new setting, it needs to be well motivated.
